        "# **Theory Answers**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of methods (functions). It enables modular, reusable, and organized code by modeling real-world entities as objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that describe the behavior and properties of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with the attributes and behaviors defined in its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction is hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features, letting programmers focus on high-level functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components, enhancing security and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore) methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods with names surrounded by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__). They allow custom behavior for built-in Python operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchical class relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. The same method or operation behaves differently on different classes, depending on their implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by defining private or protected attributes/methods using naming conventions (e.g., prefixing with _ or __) and using property decorators to control attribute access.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A constructor (__init__ method) is a special method called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class methods (decorated with @classmethod) receive the class as their first argument (cls) and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static methods (decorated with @staticmethod) do not access the class or instance state and behave like regular functions within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python does not support method overloading directly. Instead, it achieves similar effects using default parameters or variable-length arguments in methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The @property decorator allows defining getter methods to access private attributes as properties, often used to implement encapsulation in a Pythonic way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility, allowing new classes to be introduced seamlessly into existing code structures and methods to operate on objects of different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation) and cannot be instantiated. Itâ€™s often defined using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code reusability via inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity and easier code maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enhanced security via encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flexibility and extensibility via polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "- Models real-world entities intuitively\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared among all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class, combining their attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of an object, used by print().\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__: Returns an unambiguous string representation of an object, used mostly for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- super() returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class, enabling you to call overridden methods in inheritance hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup. It should be used sparingly due to unpredictability in garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- @staticmethod does not receive any implicit first argument and cannot access or modify class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod receives the class as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows a base class reference to point to objects of its subclasses. Methods can be called on these references, and Python will execute the subclass's version if it exists (dynamic method resolution).\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method chaining occurs when methods return self (the instance), so multiple methods can be called in a single statement (e.g., obj.method1().method2()).\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defining __call__ in a class makes its instances callable like functions, enabling additional flexibility in object behavior.\n"
